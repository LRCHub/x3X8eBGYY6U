Wise men say only fools rush in
But I, I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I, I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be, oh-oh
And take, take my hand, take my whole life too
For I, I can't help falling in love with you

Oh, like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be, oh-oh
Take, take my hand, take my whole life too
For I, I can't help falling in love with you, mm-mm

Oh, I, I can't help falling in love with you
